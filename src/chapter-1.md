Workplace culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and practices that define an organization's work environment.

The science of workplace culture explores the ways in which workplace culture influences employee behavior, attitudes, and performance.

Key findings from the science of workplace culture include:

- **Workplace culture can influence employee behavior and attitudes**: Employees are more likely to engage in positive behaviors and attitudes when they feel valued, respected, and supported.

By understanding the science of workplace culture, organizations can develop evidence-based strategies for improving workplace culture and promoting employee satisfaction, engagement, and success.
